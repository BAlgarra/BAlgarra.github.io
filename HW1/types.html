                    <p>Machine learning relies on a variety of model types and techniques that allow algorithms to learn
                        from data in different ways. Broadly, these can be categorized into supervised, unsupervised,
                        semi-supervised, and reinforcement learning. In supervised learning, models are trained on
                        labeled data to perform tasks such as classification (predicting categories) or regression
                        (predicting continuous values). Common supervised models include linear regression, logistic
                        regression, support vector machines (SVMs), and decision trees. Unsupervised learning, on the
                        other hand, deals with unlabeled data, with techniques like clustering (e.g., k-means) and
                        dimensionality reduction (e.g., principal component analysis, or PCA) used to uncover hidden
                        patterns. Semi-supervised learning combines elements of both, while reinforcement learning
                        trains agents through trial-and-error interactions with an environment.</p>

                <p>Another important family of techniques is ensemble learning, which improves performance by combining
                    multiple models. Methods such as bagging (e.g., random forests), boosting (e.g., AdaBoost, XGBoost),
                    and stacking leverage the strengths of different models to achieve higher accuracy and robustness.
                    Probabilistic models, including naïve Bayes classifiers and Bayesian networks, incorporate
                    probability theory to handle uncertainty in data.</p>
                <p>In recent years, neural networks and deep learning have become prominent, extending the scope of
                    model types beyond traditional approaches. Neural networks consist of layers of interconnected nodes
                    (or “neurons”) that can approximate complex functions. Architectures like convolutional neural
                    networks (CNNs) excel in image processing, while transformers dominate natural language processing.
                    These techniques represent a major shift in ML, enabling state-of-the-art performance across domains
                    such as speech recognition, computer vision, and generative AI.</p>
