                    <p>Machine learning (ML) is a branch of artificial intelligence that focuses on building systems
                        that
                        can automatically learn from data and
                        improve over time without being explicitly programmed. Instead of hard-coding rules, ML models
                        find
                        patterns, relationships, and structures
                        in data to make predictions, classifications, or decisions. The learning process involves
                        training
                        algorithms on datasets, allowing them to
                        generalize from past observations to handle new, unseen inputs.</p>
                    <p>At its core, ML encompasses different model types and techniques, such as decision trees, support
                        vector machines, ensemble methods, and probabilistic models. These methods vary in how they
                        represent
                        knowledge and handle complexity, from simple linear models to more sophisticated techniques that
                        capture
                        non-linear relationships.</p>

                <p>A significant part of modern ML involves neural networks, particularly deep learning architectures.
                    Neural networks consist of layers of interconnected nodes that transform data through weighted
                    connections. Variants such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs) excel at image recognition, while
                    recurrent neural networks (RNNs) and transformers are powerful for sequential and language tasks.
                    These
                    models have driven major breakthroughs in computer vision, natural language processing, and
                    generative
                    AI.</p>
                <p>Machine learning has wide-ranging applications and domains, from everyday uses like spam filtering,
                    recommender systems, and virtual assistants, to critical fields such as healthcare diagnostics,
                    autonomous vehicles, finance, robotics, and scientific discovery. As techniques advance, ML
                    continues to
                    expand into emerging areas like explainable AI, fairness and ethics in decision-making, and even
                    quantum-enhanced learning.</p>
