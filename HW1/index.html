            <p>A significant part of modern ML involves neural networks, particularly deep learning architectures.
                Neural networks consist of layers of interconnected nodes that transform data through weighted
                connections. Variants such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs) excel at image recognition, while
                recurrent neural networks (RNNs) and transformers are powerful for sequential and language tasks.
                These
                models have driven major breakthroughs in computer vision, natural language processing, and
                generative
                AI.</p>
            <p>Machine learning has wide-ranging applications and domains, from everyday uses like spam filtering,
                recommender systems, and virtual assistants, to critical fields such as healthcare diagnostics,
                autonomous vehicles, finance, robotics, and scientific discovery. As techniques advance, ML
                continues to
                expand into emerging areas like explainable AI, fairness and ethics in decision-making, and even
                quantum-enhanced learning.</p>
