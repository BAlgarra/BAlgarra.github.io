                    <p>Machine learning makes use of different kinds of models and techniques that help algorithms learn
                        from data in unique ways. These approaches are generally grouped into supervised, unsupervised,
                        semi-supervised, and reinforcement learning. In supervised learning, models are trained with
                        labeled data to handle tasks like classification (sorting items into categories) or regression
                        (predicting numbers). Some well-known supervised models are linear regression, logistic
                        regression, SVMs, and decision trees. Unsupervised learning works with unlabeled data, using
                        methods like clustering (e.g., k-means) or dimensionality reduction (e.g., PCA) to uncover
                        patterns. Semi-supervised learning mixes aspects of both supervised and unsupervised approaches,
                        while reinforcement learning focuses on teaching agents through trial and error in an
                        environment.</p>
                    <p>Another useful set of techniques is ensemble learning, which combines multiple models to get
                        better results. Methods such as bagging (like random forests), boosting (such as AdaBoost or
                        XGBoost), and stacking blend the strengths of different models to boost accuracy and
                        reliability. Probabilistic models—like naïve Bayes and Bayesian networks—bring in probability
                        theory to deal with uncertainty in data.</p>

                <p>More recently, neural networks and deep learning have taken center stage, pushing ML beyond
                    traditional models. Neural networks are built from layers of connected “neurons” that can represent
                    complex relationships in data. Architectures like CNNs are especially good at image tasks, while
                    transformers dominate natural language processing. These techniques have driven huge leaps in
                    performance across fields like speech recognition, computer vision, and generative AI.</p>
