                    <p>Neural networks are machine learning models inspired by how the human brain processes
                        information. They’re made up of layers of nodes, or “neurons,” that pass signals forward after
                        applying simple transformations. By stacking many layers together, the network can gradually
                        learn and represent very complex patterns in data. Training happens by adjusting the connections
                        (or weights) between neurons so the model improves at predicting the right outcomes.</p>
                    <p>Different network architectures are built for different kinds of problems. Convolutional neural
                        networks (CNNs), for example, are especially good at image-related tasks because they can detect
                        patterns like edges and textures. Recurrent networks (RNNs) were once popular for sequential
                        data like text or time series, but more recently, transformers have become the dominant
                        architecture for natural language processing because of their ability to handle long-range
                        relationships in text.</p>

                <p>Deep learning, which uses large and multi-layered neural networks, has pushed machine learning far
                    beyond traditional methods. These models now power cutting-edge applications in speech recognition,
                    computer vision, and generative AI, making them one of the most important drivers of recent progress
                    in artificial intelligence.</p>
